# Expert and Master AI Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented advanced AI difficulty levels 4 (Expert) and 5 (Master) for the "Eat Your Neighbor" hexagonal board game, featuring sophisticated algorithms and strategic evaluation functions.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning
- **Expert Level**: 3-ply search depth with 2-second thinking time
- **Master Level**: 4-ply search depth with 3-second thinking time
- **Move Ordering**: Moves sorted by initial evaluation for better pruning efficiency
- **Time Management**: Hard time limits to prevent excessive thinking times

### 2. Advanced Position Evaluation System

#### Territory Control
- Evaluates area influence based on adjacent hexes
- Scores based on controlled empty spaces and threatened enemy positions

#### Connectivity Analysis
- Rewards keeping pieces connected in larger creatures
- Bonuses for creature sizes and inter-creature connections
- Penalizes isolated pieces

#### Phase-Specific Strategy
- **Opening Phase** (<8 pieces placed): Focus on central control and spread
- **Midgame Phase** (8-16 pieces): Balance offense/defense, support existing creatures
- **Endgame Phase** (>16 pieces): Consolidation and direct threats

#### Tactical Pattern Recognition
- **Fork Attacks**: Threatening multiple enemy creatures simultaneously
- **Defensive Formations**: Protecting vulnerable size-4 creatures from swarming
- **Chain Attacks**: Setting up multi-turn combinations
- **Breakthrough Opportunities**: Penetrating enemy territory clusters

#### Enhanced Creature Placement
- Context-dependent evaluation of creature sizes
- Edge positioning bonuses (harder to surround)
- Vulnerability assessment for size-4 creatures

#### Defensive Value Assessment
- Blocks opponent's immediate threats
- Prevents opponent winning moves
- Protects friendly vulnerable creatures

#### Future Potential Analysis
- Expansion opportunities around placed pieces
- Combination potential for future moves
- Strategic positioning for later advantages

### 3. User Interface Enhancements

#### Difficulty Selection
- 5 difficulty buttons (1-5) with clear labeling
- Visual selection highlighting for current difficulty
- Compact layout fitting all levels

#### AI Thinking Indicator

- Difficulty level displayed during AI turns
- Variable thinking times based on complexity:
  - Easy/Medium/Hard: 500ms base delay
  - Expert: 800ms + calculation time
  - Master: 1000ms + calculation time

#### Enhanced Status Display
- Real-time difficulty level indication
- Clear feedback when AI is processing moves
- Smooth transition between thinking and move execution

### 4. Performance Optimizations

#### Fast Move Evaluation
- Lightweight evaluation function for move ordering
- Reduced complexity calculations for time-critical operations
- Optimized creature detection and analysis

#### Memory Management
- Efficient board state copying for simulation
- Minimal object creation during search
- Garbage collection friendly algorithms

#### Search Optimizations
- Alpha-beta pruning with move ordering
- Iterative deepening consideration
- Time-bounded search with graceful fallbacks
