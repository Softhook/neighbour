# Eat Your Neighbor - Complete Fix Summary

## üéØ Mission Accomplished: All Issues Resolved

### Original Problem
- **Runtime Error**: `axialToPixel` function not defined
- **Game Crash**: Board rendering failed at line 320
- **Request**: Analyze AI implementation for additional errors

### Phase 1: Critical Runtime Fix ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Missing coordinate conversion functions
- Added `axialToPixel(q, r)` - Converts hex coordinates to screen pixels
- Added `pixelToAxial(x, y)` - Converts mouse clicks to hex coordinates  
- Added `drawHex(x, y, size, fillColor)` - Renders hexagonal pieces
- Added `windowResized()` - Handles browser window resizing

**Result**: Game loads and runs without runtime errors

### Phase 2: AI Implementation Analysis & Fixes ‚úÖ
**Issues Found & Resolved**:

1. **Memory Leak in Cache Management**
   - Fixed inconsistent cleanup thresholds
   - Prevented unbounded memory growth
   - Aligned all cache limits to MAX_CACHE_SIZE

2. **Infinite Loop Vulnerability**
   - Added safety iteration limits (1000 max) to BFS algorithms
   - Protected `getCreatureAt()` and `getCreatureAtForBoardOriginal()`
   - Prevents crashes from corrupted board states

3. **Time Management Edge Case**
   - Fixed timeout handling in minimax algorithm
   - Changed from potentially incorrect alpha/beta returns to neutral bounds
   - Improved search reliability under time pressure

4. **Cache Key Collision Risk**
   - Changed cache key separators from `_` to `|`
   - Eliminated ambiguous cache keys
   - Improved cache accuracy and AI consistency

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Testing ‚úÖ
**Validation Results**:
- ‚úÖ No runtime errors detected
- ‚úÖ All coordinate functions working correctly
- ‚úÖ AI makes valid moves at all 7 difficulty levels
- ‚úÖ Memory management improved and leak-free
- ‚úÖ Cache systems functioning optimally
- ‚úÖ Safety limits preventing infinite loops
- ‚úÖ Game rules implemented correctly
