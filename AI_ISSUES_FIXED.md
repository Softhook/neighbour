# AI Implementation Issues Found and Fixed

## Overview
After analyzing the optimized "Eat Your Neighbor" game AI implementation, several issues were identified and resolved to improve stability, performance, and correctness.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Cache Management Memory Leak
**Problem**: Cache cleanup threshold inconsistency could lead to unbounded memory growth
- Individual cache checks triggered cleanup at `MAX_CACHE_SIZE` (1,000,000)
- But cleanup function only executed when size exceeded `MAX_CACHE_SIZE * CACHE_CLEANUP_THRESHOLD` (800,000)
- This created a gap where cleanup was called but didn't execute

**Fix**: Modified `cleanupCaches()` to use consistent `MAX_CACHE_SIZE` threshold

### 2. Infinite Loop Protection in BFS
**Problem**: Breadth-first search in creature detection functions lacked safety limits
- `getCreatureAt()` and `getCreatureAtForBoardOriginal()` could theoretically loop infinitely with corrupted board state
- No maximum iteration check as failsafe

**Fix**: Added iteration counter with 1000 iteration safety limit to both functions

### 3. Time Management Edge Case
**Problem**: Timeout handling in minimax could return incorrect bounds
- When time limit exceeded, returned `alpha` or `beta` without considering current search state
- Could return inappropriate values in certain alpha-beta pruning scenarios

**Fix**: Modified timeout return to use neutral bounds (-1000/1000) instead of potentially incorrect alpha/beta

### 4. Cache Key Collision Risk
**Problem**: Cache key generation used underscores as separators
- If parameters contained underscores, could create ambiguous cache keys
- Risk of cache collisions leading to incorrect AI behavior

**Fix**: Changed cache key separator from `_` to `|` to reduce collision risk

## Performance Optimizations Preserved
- Transposition table with alpha-beta bounds
- Move ordering with history heuristics and killer moves
- Iterative deepening search
- Multiple evaluation caches
- Time-bounded search

## AI Difficulty Levels Working Correctly
✅ Easy (randomized moves with basic evaluation)
✅ Medium (defensive play with creature size bonuses)
✅ Hard (territory control and threat assessment)
✅ Expert (5-depth minimax with optimizations)
✅ Master (6-depth search with enhanced evaluation)
✅ Grandmaster (7-depth search with reduced randomness)
✅ Ultimate (8-depth search with minimal randomness)

## Code Quality Improvements
- Added safety limits to prevent infinite loops
- Improved cache management consistency
- Fixed potential memory leaks
- Enhanced error handling in time-critical sections
- Reduced cache key collision probability

## Testing Status
- ✅ Game loads without runtime errors
- ✅ Coordinate functions work correctly
- ✅ AI makes valid moves at all difficulty levels
- ✅ Cache systems function properly
- ✅ No memory leaks detected in normal gameplay

## Files Modified
- `sketch.js` - Fixed AI implementation issues
- All coordinate conversion functions working
- Cache management improved
- BFS safety limits added
