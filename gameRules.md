# EAT YOUR NEIGHBOR

## Get points for **eating creatures in a growing ecosystem. Bigger eats smaller and the smallest swarm the biggest.**

### Equipment

- 30 black and 30 white player pieces (circles or hexagons):

### Setup

- One player takes the black pieces, and the other takes the white.
- Set the board on the center of the table.

### Definition

- A *creature* is any set of connected pieces of the same color on the board. A single unconnected piece is also a creature. Here are three creatures of different sizes:

## Gameplay

1. **Players take turns placing a piece of their color on any empty space, without creating a creature larger than size-4.** 

    1. **Eating:** After you place a piece, the resulting creature - and only that creature - eats (removes) all adjacent opponent creatures exactly one size smaller than it. Example:
        
    2. **Swarming:** If you place a size-1 creature next to an opponent's size-4 creature and at least two of your other size-1 creatures are already next to it, eat the size-4 creature. Example:

    3. Keep eaten pieces in front of you.
2. **The game ends when a player can’t place legally or has eaten 12 pieces.** 

The player with the most eaten pieces wins; ties go to the last player to make a legal move.


## The Keystone Creature Expansion

[still in development]

This expansion adds a deck of 12 “Keystone Creature” cards. It creates greater scoring variety, and changes the goals each time you play.


- During setup, shuffle the Keystone Creature deck, draw 4 cards, and place them face-up next to the board. for example:

![Group 16.png](attachment:761eafe3-4269-4c72-bdba-e92e32e4129e:Group_16.png)

![Group 77.png](attachment:998dfc15-2247-4fbc-988c-00ba41bfba00:Group_77.png)

At game’s end, in addition to normal scoring, you also get 3 points for each Keystone creature you have on the board. If you have multiple instances of the same type of Keystone creature on the board, you get 3 points for each.

If there’s a tie, the player with the most eaten pieces wins. If there’s still a tie, the last player to make a legal move wins.

## Premortem and Notes

- This is a product premortem, not a game premortem
- It takes a lot to get people interested in an abstract game. I need very special branding, and very special marketing, to make it happen. Can I dig deep enough?
- This is made more difficult by the shared board and the minimally differentiated pieces (just two colors of the same shape). The product design also has to be extraordinary.
- I don’t really trust my judgement about abstract games: I love them too much. They’re my heart.

## Alternative Rules Wordings

1. **Players take turns placing a piece of their color on any empty space, without creating a creature larger than size-4.**
    1. After placement, the resulting creature eats (captures) all adjacent opponent creatures exactly one size smaller.
    2. If you place a size-1 next to a size-4 opponent creature, and at least two other adjacent size-1s of yours are present, you eat the size-4.
    3. Keep eaten pieces in front of you.
2. **The game ends when a player can’t place legally or has eaten 12 pieces.** The player with the most eaten pieces wins; ties go to the last player to make a legal move.
